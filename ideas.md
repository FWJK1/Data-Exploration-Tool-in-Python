# Project Ideas

### New Census Comparison Page
- [ ] Year selection for base and comparison datasets
- [ ] Bar chart sorting (ascending, descending, alphabetical, etc.)
- [ ] Show tabular data feature with Excel download button
- [ ] Migrate filters off of main page (likely not implemented while using streamlit)
- [ ] Dual scroll mechanism in side by side comparison with middle separator

### Zoning Page
- [ ] Separate mapping, area stats, and law comparisons into three separate tabs
- [ ] Do not load the zoning dataset until geographic filters are selected (to speed up map rendering time)
