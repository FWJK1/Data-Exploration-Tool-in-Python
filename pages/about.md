#### Open-Research Community Accelerator (ORCA)
The [Open Research Community Accelerator] is an initiative that grows the impact of academic research by making research products accessible to other academics, local businesses, and community members through open source projects. ORCA creates these products through student project teams called Pods -- groups of dynamic and passionate students who learn industry open source practices by working on real products destined for public use. This program is run and funded by the University of Vermont [Open Source Program Office (VERSO)].

ORCA's goals are to produce impactful, accessible, open source research tools by training tomorrow's workforce in marketable open source skills. This Repository contains all the supporting documentation and policies for the ORCA program. These documents are meant to help new ORCA members learns the program, show project sponsors how we work, and provide a template that can be "forked" to other academic institutions.
